# Deep-Learning
This repo contains my all of deep learning related projects ,works..
Please mention my name if you use any of the codes

In this project, I've built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). I've used OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once you i trained the model, saved, and exported the CNN, I wasÂ  directly able to serve the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.
